Apr 09 15:34:57.373 [notice] We compiled with OpenSSL 101010bf: OpenSSL 1.1.1k  25 Mar 2021 and we are running with OpenSSL 101010bf: 1.1.1k. These two versions should be binary compatible.

Apr 09 15:35:02.000 [notice] The current consensus has no exit nodes. Tor can only build internal paths, such as paths to onion services.
Apr 09 15:35:02.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 45% (requesting_descriptors): Asking for relay descriptors
Apr 09 15:35:02.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We need more microdescriptors: we have 0/6715, and can only build 0% of likely paths. (We have 0% of guards bw, 0% of midpoint bw, and 0% of end bw (no exits in consensus, using mid) = 0% of path bw.)
